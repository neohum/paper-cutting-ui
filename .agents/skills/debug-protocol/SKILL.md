# Debug Protocol

Guess-and-check debugging burns context, "fixes" symptoms while planting new bugs, and teaches you nothing about the system. Bugs fall to controlled experiments. Treat every bug as a hypothesis to falsify, not a vibe to patch.

## The protocol

### 0. Check whether it is already solved

The moment before you dig is the cheapest moment to stop digging. Spend one minute first:

- `node scripts/loop/knowledge.ts recall "<error message or symptom>"` searches what this and other projects already learned (hub first, local fallback).
- `git log --oneline -- <path>` and `git log --all --grep "<symptom>"`: was this fixed on another branch or broken by a recent commit? Check the issue tracker for the same symptom.
- Does the codebase, the standard library, or an existing dependency already handle this?

A hit is a lead, not a verdict: a recalled fix still goes through reproduce and prove below.

### 1. Reproduce first

Get a minimal, deterministic reproduction before touching any code. The best form is a failing test; second best is a small script or exact command. If you cannot reproduce it, you cannot fix it, because you will never know whether you did. For flaky issues, find the loop or seed that makes the failure reliable before proceeding.

### 2. Read the whole error

The full stack trace, top to bottom. The FIRST error, not the last (later errors are usually fallout). The exact file and line. Do not pattern-match on the first familiar word and sprint off; the trace usually names the culprit outright, and agents that skim traces fix the wrong function with total confidence.

### 3. State one hypothesis

Write it down in one sentence: "X happens because Y." If you cannot phrase it that precisely, you are not ready to edit code yet; go read more.

### 4. Run the cheapest experiment that could kill it

A log line printing the actual value, an assertion, a debugger breakpoint, a bisected input. The goal is to make the hypothesis falsifiable fast. Print what the value IS, not what you assume it is; half of all bugs die the moment someone looks at the real data.

### 5. One variable at a time

Change one thing per experiment. If you change three things and it works, you now have a superstition, not a fix, and two of those changes are unexplained diffs in your PR. When a fix attempt fails, revert it before trying the next; never stack a second fix on top of the first.

When several layers are involved (CI -> build -> deploy, API -> service -> DB), instrument first: log what enters and leaves each boundary and run once to learn which layer breaks. Otherwise you fix layers that were never broken. If similar code elsewhere works, read it in full and list every difference, including the ones that "shouldn't matter".

### 6. Bisect when lost

For regressions, `git bisect` between the last known good commit and now; it finds the guilty commit in log-n steps. For data or code-path mysteries, binary-search: cut the input in half, disable half the pipeline, and keep halving until the problem corner is small.

### 7. Fix the root cause, not the crash site

Where the pain shows up is rarely where the mistake lives. Before patching, ask once: why did the system allow this state at all? A null check at the crash site hides the bug; fixing whatever produced the null removes it.

### 8. Prove it

The reproduction from step 1 now passes. Keep it as a regression test. Run the full relevant suite so the fix did not break a neighbor. Then remove every debug print, log line, and temporary hack you added along the way. Leave the campsite clean.

### 9. Remember the solution (지식 등록)

Once proven, register the resolved symptom and root cause so future runs and other agents never repeat the investigation:
`node scripts/loop/knowledge.ts remember "<symptom/error>" "<verified solution and root cause>"`

## The stuck rule

Count failed fix attempts on the same problem.

- **After two:** if you were guess-and-checking, this is where the protocol starts. Revert, go back to step 1 with what the failures taught you, and do not reach for "just once more".
- **After three:** stop editing; do not attempt a fourth fix. Re-read the code fresh and question the assumption so basic you never tested it: is this code even running? Is this the config that is loaded? Is the process you are looking at the process that is failing? Am I editing the file that gets imported?

Past three failures the hypothesis is rarely what is wrong; the structure is. The signs: each fix surfaces a new symptom somewhere else, or the proper fix "would need a large refactor". Ask whether the design itself is right or only kept out of inertia, then stop patching and escalate: summarize the symptom, the hypotheses tried, the evidence gathered, and the structural question, and hand it to the user (or the lead, in the loop). A crisp stuck-report is senior behavior; a fourth random patch is not.

Principal angle: if the root cause lives in shared or upstream code, other callers are hitting it blind; fix it once at the shared layer instead of patching every call site that happened to notice.

## Warning signs: go back to step 1

- "Fix it fast now, investigate later" or "the urgency means no time for process". Systematic debugging is faster than guess-and-revert.
- "Just try changing X and see" / "It's probably X, fix that" / "I don't fully understand it, but this should work".
- Listing solutions before tracing where the bad value came from.
- "Skip the test, I'll check it manually."
- The user asks "is that actually true?", "show me", or "stop guessing": you assumed instead of confirming.
